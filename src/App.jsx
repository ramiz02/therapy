          <h2 className='description'>The integrated approach to yoga therapy (IAYT) model is based on the principle that “<span className='heading'>the root of all psychosocial illnesses is in the mind; which causes an internal imbalance due to long standing stressful and demanding situations of life.</span>”</h2>
          <h2>This model uses Pancha Kosha as a foundation to understand human existence at different levels and development of illness through the complex interaction of these levels and external life style factors.  IAYT slows down the loop of uncontrolled speed of thoughts (stress) through several techniques that use the principle of “successive stimulations followed by progressive relaxation and the rest” to correct the imbalances, promote “mastery over the mind” and harmonize the disturbances at each of the five levels (Pancha Kosa). Based on the above Pancha Kosa concept, the IAYT model incorporates varied yogic practices at each level to help patients with different disorders deal with their problems. The integrated approach to yoga therapy (IAYT) model looks at health from a holistic perspective (vs reductionist approach in addressing symptoms only) and to restore health at all levels.</h2>
